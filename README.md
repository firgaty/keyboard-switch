# keyboard-switch

Simple, yet effective, script written in Python to change keyboard layout on Linux by using `setxkbmap`.

## Why

Maybe my google-fu failed me. Maybe I didn't read enough of the `IBus`, `fcitx`, `xkb-switch` documentation. Maybe. But I spent enough time doing so without reaching a satisfying answer as to how to switch layouts using them while also switching mapping options and variants all at the same time. Neither of the mentioned three options allowed to do so AFAIK. So I decided to write this little script.

## What it is

It's a script that you use to switch between registered layouts via CLI. 

To register a layout, set yourself to it (via `setxkbmap`) and call `kbswitch -a <name>`, `<name>` being how you want your layout to be remembered as. `keyboard-switch` will store the layout's current `model`, `layout`, `variant` and `option` list under the name `<name>`. Next, anytime you will use this script to "switch" to this layout (e.g `kbswitch -s <name>`), it will call `setxkbmap` with the aforementioned registered options.

## Usage

```
usage: kbswitch [-h] [-n] [-p] [-s NAME] [-S N] [-a NAME] [-r NAME] [-R N] [-o FROM TO] [-c] [-l] [-d] [--notify]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a NAME, --add NAME   Add/Register current mapping with name NAME
  -n, --next            Next mapping
  -p, --previous        Previous mapping
  -s NAME, --set NAME   Set current mapping to NAME
  -S N, --set-number N  Set current mapping to NUMBER
  -r NAME, --remove NAME
                        Remove mapping with name NAME
  -R N, --remove-number N
                        Remove mapping with order N
  -o FROM TO, --order FROM TO
                        Reorder mapping at place FROM to place TO
  -c, --current         Print current layout
  -l, --list            Lists layouts in order
  -d, --details         Print layouts in order with details
  --notify              Prints change to notification window using libnotify
```

### Example

#### Add layout
  
(Current layout is `gb(extd)`)

```sh
$ kbswitch -a gb_qwerty  # register current layout with name `gb_qwerty`
$ kbswitch -l  # list
+  0 gb_qwerty
```

> Changed layout to colemak

```sh
$ kbswitch -a gb_colemak  # register current layout with name `gb_colemak`
$ kbswitch -l  # list
+  0 gb_qwerty
   1 gb_colemak
```

Internally, the last mapping is still considered the current one because this program isn'tsynchronized to anything.

#### Switch layout

Using the last two registered layouts and starting under the gb QWERTY layout.

```sh
$ kbswitch -n  # next
$ kbswitch -l  # list
   0 gb_qwerty
+  1 gb_colemak
```

VoilÃ , switched ! We can also select a layout using it's name or ID:

```sh
$ kbswitch -l # initially
   0 gb_qwerty
+  1 gb_colemak
   2 fr_azerty
   3 fr_colemak
$ kbswitch -s fr_colemak  # select with name
$ kbswitch -l
   0 gb_qwerty
   1 gb_colemak
   2 fr_azerty
+  3 fr_colemak
```

Equivalently:

```sh
$ kbswitch -S 3 # select with position
  ```

#### Reorder
  
```sh
$ kbswitch -l  # initially
   0 gb_qwerty
   1 gb_colemak
   2 fr_azerty
+  3 fr_colemak
$ kbswitch -o 2 1  # reorder 2 -> 1 (put `fr_azerty` at place 1)
$ kbswitch -l  # result
   0 gb_qwerty
   1 fr_azerty
   2 gb_colemak
+  3 fr_colemak
```

#### Remove

```sh
$ kbswitch -l  # initially
   0 gb_qwerty
   1 fr_azerty
   2 gb_colemak
+  3 fr_colemak
$ kbswitch -r fr_azerty  # remove by name
$ kbswitch -l  # result
   0 gb_qwerty
   1 gb_colemak
+  2 fr_colemak
```

Equivalently:

```sh
$ kbswitch -R 2  # Remove by position
```

#### Print
  
- __Names in order__:

```sh
$ kbswitch -l  # list
+  0 gb_qwerty
   1 gb_colemak
   2 fr_colemak
```

- __Current layout with options, variants, etc...__:

```sh
$ kbswitch -c  # current
gb_qwerty
  model:        pc
  layout:       gb
  variant:      extd
  options:
```

- __All registered layouts with the above informations__:

```sh
$ kbswitch -d  # details
gb_qwerty
  model:        pc
  layout:       gb
  variant:      extd
  options:
gb_colemak
  model:        pc105
  layout:       gb(cmk_ed_us)
  variant:
  options:      misc:extend,lv5:caps_switch_lock,grp:shifts_toggle,compose:menu,misc:cmk_curl_dh
fr_colemak
  model:        pc105
  layout:       fr(cmk_ed_us)
  variant:
  options:      misc:extend,lv5:caps_switch_lock,grp:shifts_toggle,compose:menu,misc:cmk_curl_dh
```  


#### Notification

If you want to have a notification of a layout switch via `libnotify`, you may add the argument `--notify`.

```sh
$ kbswitch -n --notify  # changes to next layout and sends a notification
```

## Ideas on how to use

Set `kbswitch -n --notify` as a hotkey in your windows manager config.

e.g i3:

```i3
# Switch to next keyboard layout using mod + Space
bindsym $mod+space exec --no-startup-id kbswitch -n --notify
```

## IBus

If you desperately need `IBus`, as I do because Telegram doesn't register dead keys and I type in french; in `IBus`'s `Preference > Advanced > Keyboard Layout`, check `Use system keyboard layout`. You will be able to register dead keys with `IBus` while using the system keyboard set by `setxkbmap`.

## Storage

All registered layouts are stored as JSON strings in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/keyboard-switch/`, usually being `~/.config/keyboard-switch/`, in the file `mappings`. The current mapping/layout is saved in the file `current` in the same directory.
